# Spam Email Detector Using NLP

Welcome to the Spam Email Detector project repository! This project, developed as part of the CS5002 class at Northeastern University, leverages Natural Language Processing (NLP) methods to accurately identify and filter out spam emails, helping users maintain a clean and relevant inbox.

## Overview

The rise of digital communication has also seen a significant increase in unwanted emails, commonly known as spam. These irrelevant or inappropriate messages clutter our email inboxes and may sometimes contain harmful links or scams. This class project aims to tackle this issue by building a machine-learning model that can classify emails as spam or not spam based on their content.

## Features

- Text preprocessing including tokenization, normalization, and removal of stop words
- Feature extraction using techniques like Bag of Words (BoW) and Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF)
- Training of machine learning models such as Naive Bayes classification
- Evaluation of model performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score
- A user-friendly interface for testing the model with new email texts

## Built With

- Python - The programming language used
- Scikit-learn - The machine learning library used for modeling
- NLTK - The NLP library used for text processing
